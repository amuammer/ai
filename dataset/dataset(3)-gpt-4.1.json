    "prompt": " Add logging to the application.",
    "response": "Certainly! Adding logging to your application is a great step to improve observability, debugging, and maintenance. Here’s a general outline and example for adding logging to an application, assuming you’re using Python. If you’re using a different language or framework, let me know for a more tailored solution!\n\n---\n\n## 1. Python Example: Using the built-in `logging` module\n\n### Step 1: Import and Configure Logging\n\nAt the top of your main file (e.g., `app.py`):\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\nlogging.basicConfig(\n    level=logging.INFO,  # or DEBUG for more verbosity\n    format=\"%(asctime)s [%(levelname)s] %(message)s\",\n    handlers=[\n        logging.FileHandler(\"app.log\"),\n        logging.StreamHandler()\n    ]\n)\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n```\n\n### Step 2: Add Logging Statements\n\nReplace existing `print()` statements or supplement your code with logger calls:\n\n```python\ndef process_data(data):\n    logger.info(\"Processing data: %s\", data)\n    try:\n        # Your processing logic\n        result = data + 1\n        logger.debug(\"Processed result: %s\", result)\n        return result\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.exception(\"Error processing data!\")\n        raise\n\ndef main():\n    logger.info(\"Application started.\")\n    data = 5\n    result = process_data(data)\n    logger.info(\"Result: %s\", result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. Adding Logging to a Web Framework (e.g., Flask Example)\n\nIf you're using Flask:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask\nimport logging\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n\n@app.route(\"/\")\ndef hello():\n    app.logger.info(\"Home page accessed!\")\n    return \"Hello, World!\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. General Tips\n\n- Use different logging levels: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`\n- Log to files for persistent logs (`FileHandler`)\n- Use `logger.exception()` in except blocks for full stack traces\n- Avoid logging sensitive information\n\n---\n\nIf you specify your application's language (e.g., Node.js, Java, Go) or framework, I can provide a code example tailored to your stack!"

To provide helpful documentation, I’ll need some context about **which system** you’re referring to (e.g., web application, IoT platform, microservices ecosystem, etc.). \n\nHowever, here’s a **generic template for system architecture documentation**. You can modify it based on your specific context.\n\n---\n\n# System Architecture Documentation\n\n## 1. Overview\n\nThis document outlines the architecture of the system, detailing its components, their interactions, data flow, technologies used, and integration points. The system is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and robust.\n\n---\n\n## 2. High-Level Architecture Diagram\n\n```\n[Client Apps]\n     |\n     v\n [API Gateway] --- [Admin Interface]\n     |\n     v\n [Backend Services] <--- [Auth Service]\n     |\n     v\n [Database(s)] --- [External Services]\n```\n\n*(Replace with an actual diagram as necessary.)*\n\n---\n\n## 3. Components\n\n### 3.1 Client Applications\n\n- **Web Application:** React.js SPA served over HTTPS.\n- **Mobile Application:** Flutter/iOS/Android native apps.\n- **API Consumers:** Third-party integrations using provided APIs.\n\n### 3.2 API Gateway\n\n- Handles HTTP(S) requests from clients.\n- Performs authentication and rate limiting.\n- Routes requests to appropriate backend services.\n\n### 3.3 Backend Services (Microservices)\n\n- **User Service:** Manages user accounts, profiles, preferences.\n- **Product Service:** CRUD operations for products.\n- **Order Service:** Handles orders, payments, and invoicing.\n- **Notification Service:** Delivers emails, SMS, and push notifications.\n\n#### Inter-service Communication\n\n- Primarily via RESTful APIs or gRPC.\n- Asynchronous events via message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ/Kafka).\n\n### 3.4 Auth Service\n\n- Implements OAuth2/OpenID Connect.\n- Issues and validates JWT tokens for authentication/authorization.\n\n### 3.5 Database(s)\n\n- **Primary DB:** PostgreSQL for transactional data.\n- **NoSQL DB:** MongoDB/Redis for caching and some non-relational needs.\n\n### 3.6 External Services\n\n- **Payment Gateway:** Stripe/PayPal integration.\n- **Email/SMS Providers:** SendGrid, Twilio.\n- **Cloud Storage:** AWS S3 for file uploads.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Data Flow\n\n1. The client sends a request (e.g., place order) via the API Gateway.\n2. The API Gateway authenticates the request via Auth Service.\n3. The request is routed to the relevant backend microservice.\n4. The service reads/writes data to the database.\n5. For async operations (e.g., sending notifications), a message is placed on the queue.\n6. Notification Service processes the message and interacts with external providers.\n7. Response returned back to client through API Gateway.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Deployment & Infrastructure\n\n- **Deployment:** Docker containers orchestrated via Kubernetes.\n- **CI/CD:** Automated deployments using GitHub Actions/Jenkins.\n- **Monitoring:** Prometheus + Grafana, ELK stack.\n- **Scalability:** Horizontal scaling of stateless services.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Security Considerations\n\n- Encrypted communication (HTTPS/TLS).\n- JWT-based authentication for API access.\n- Regular vulnerability scans and dependency checks.\n- Role-based access control within backend services.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Future Improvements\n\n- Introduction of service mesh for richer inter-service communication (e.g., Istio).\n- Migration to serverless for event-driven workloads.\n- More granular microservices decomposition.\n\n---\n\n**(End of System Architecture Document)**\n\n---\n\nIf you provide more specifics about your system (its purpose, key technologies), I can tailor this documentation to your project."

Typically, this involves:\n\n- **Catching exceptions**: Use try...except blocks (in Python) or equivalent mechanisms in other languages.\n- **Logging**: Record error information for debugging and monitoring.\n- **User-friendly messages**: Provide clear, non-technical feedback to users, avoiding raw stack traces or confusing codes.\n- **Fallbacks**: When possible, offer a default action or retry mechanism instead of failing outright.\n\n**Example (Python):**\n```python\ntry:\n    result = some_risky_operation()\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"Sorry, the file you requested was not found.\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(\"An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.\")\n    # Log the detailed error for developers\n    log_error(e)\nelse:\n    print(\"Operation succeeded:\", result)\n```\n\n**Best Practices:**\n- Only catch exceptions you can handle or provide meaningful feedback for.\n- Don’t hide errors completely—log them so developers or support can diagnose issues.\n- Ensure the application remains stable and usable even after an error.\n\nIf you have a specific language or error scenario in mind, please provide more details for a tailored example!"
